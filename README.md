# FoodGeneratorTheWorse

This is the worst food generator, you have ever seen. It only knows one recipe and this is in a bad German language.

OK, but if you realy want to run it, make sure, that python3-tkinter is installed on your machine. Please what? You don't know how to do it... OK, I will show you.

Debian/Ubuntu/Mint:

    sudo apt install python3-tk

Fedora

    sudo dnf install python3-tkinter

Now you can run it and have a lot of phun.

Please what? You are using a Microsoft Windows machine and the code does not run? 
Yeah, I am very sorry -not
